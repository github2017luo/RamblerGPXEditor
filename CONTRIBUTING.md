# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

This project is an attempt to create an open source and open data GPX editor, based on existing commercial application code.
I've started from the activity which originally was intended to be just an addition, since it was the simplest one.
Before going further, I need to improve the Openstreetmap implementation, which is rather simple at the moment. 
Feel free to propose any improvement.
